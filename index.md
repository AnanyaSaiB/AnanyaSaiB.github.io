# About Me
Hi there, I'm Ananya, a PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/index.php), [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/)! I research on improving Natural Language Processing / Understanding by building and analysing neural network models at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/), IIT Madras, guided by [Dr Mitesh M. Khapra](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/). <br/>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp I have completed my Masters in Computer Science at IIT Madras. It was, for me, a thrilling academic adventure where I explored the breadths of Computer Science by crediting courses from various domains ranging from Compilers, Cloud computing Searching and Indexing large datasets and Deep learning. I finally took a jump into the depths of Deep Learning and NLP under the guidance of [Dr Mitesh M. Khapra](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/) and continue to dive into research here as a Ph.D. student now. My research interests broadly include Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Adversarial Attacks, Explainability, Security, and AI for Social Good. <br/><br/>
You can reach me at ananya[at]cse[dot]iitm[dot]ac[dot]in or locate me in [RBCDSAI](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/contact/), IIT Madras or virtually on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AnanyaSaiB).

# Work Experience
[//]: # (Yet another comment: I worked on a research internship at Nvidia from March 2018 - Nov 2018, with mentors Dr.Mithun Das Gupta from Microsoft and Mukundhan Srinivasan from Nvidia. <br/>)
I worked for an year at Cisco as a Software Engineer from August 2015 to June 2016. I worked on OSPF routing protocol, building a data model to enable coordinating large set of routers centrally. I also worked on RCMD (Route Convergence Monitoring and Diagnostics) project to quickly detect failures in the network.

# Teaching Experience
I work as a teaching assistant(TA) for Linear Algebra and Random Processes. <br/> Earlier I have been a TA for the following courses : <br/> 
- Probability and Computing (CS5820) taught by Dr. John Augustine. (July - Dec 2017) <br/>
- Deep Learning taught by Dr. Mitesh M. Khapra - (Jan - May 2018) and (Jan - May 2019) <br/>
- Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning taught by Dr. Arun Kumar (July-Dec 2019) and by Dr. Harish Guruprasad (Jan-May 2020) <br/>

# Projects
- ## Attentive deep neural networks for Question Answering
Modelled RNNs for reading comprehension tasks, specifically to answer questions based on given passage, by exploring various attention mechanisms
- ## Dissecting Reading Comprehension models: analyzing their components
Evaluated the contribution of various attention modules and components in the existing neural network models for QA. Created simpler versions of the RACE dataset with hints to the answer in the passage or question to analyze the behaviour of various components and identified certain shortcomings in the existing models.
- ## Query plan selector for MongoDB
Implemented a query plan selector/pruner in MongoDB to reduce the number of query plans to be executed.
- ## AI-powered Pacman
Empowered pacman game character with artificial intelligence to get high scores on the game (This project was as part of edX course CS188.1x Artificial Intelligence)
- ## Supergraph search in graph databases
Graph isomorphism being an NP problem, an edge-based tree index was built to make the search algorithm faster.
- ## Mini Java compiler
Implemented an optimizing compiler for IR code generation along with optimizations of Conditional Constant Propagation and Function Inlining.
- ## Virtual Treasure Hunt
Created and hosted an online game of treasure hunt with image-based clues. A critical part of this project was sealing the game from various 'hacks' and attacks that could help someone cheat at or tamper with the game.

# Hobbies
