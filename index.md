# About Me
Hi there, I'm Ananya! I am currently doing my MTech in Computer Science at IIT Madras. I have completed an academic adventure of exploring the breadths of Computer Science by crediting courses from various domains ranging from Compilers, Cloud computing to Indexing large datasets and Deep learning. I am currently exploring the depths of Deep Learning and NLP under the guidance of [Dr Mitesh M. Khapra](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/)

# Projects
## Attentive deep neural networks for Question Answering
Modelling RNNs for reading comprehension tasks, specifically to answer questions based on given passage, by exploring various attention mechanisms
## Query plan selector for MongoDB
Implemented a query plan selector/pruner in MongoDB to reduce the number of query plans to be executed.
## AI-powered Pacman
Empowered pacman game character with artificial intelligence to get high scores on the game (This project was as part of edX course CS188.1x Artificial Intelligence)
## Supergraph search in graph databases
Graph isomorphism being an NP problem, an edge-based tree index was built to make the search algorithm faster.
## Mini Java compiler
Implemented an optimizing compiler for IR code generation along with optimizations of Conditional Constant Propagation and Function Inlining.

# Work Experience
I worked for an year at Cisco as a Software Engineer from August 2015 to June 2016. I worked on OSPF routing protocol, building a data model to enable coordinating large set of routers centrally. I also worked on RCMD (Route Convergence Monitoring and Diagnostics) project to quickly detect failures in the network.

# Teaching Experience
I work as a teaching assistant for Probability and Computing(CS5820) taught by Professor John Augustine. The work involves setting up and grading tutorials and assignments for the course.

# Academic Details
I completed my BE in Computer Science and Engineering at Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering, Mysore in 2015 with a cgpa of 9.53/10.
